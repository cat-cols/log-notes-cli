### TODO:

1. Since the script uses `OSTYPE` to decide how to open the file, users on Linux or WSL might appreciate a quick mention that they should have their `$EDITOR` variable set.
2. Add bidirectional sync between log file and clipboard?
3. Add bidirectional capabilities between related topics?
4. Add links to webpages or pdf docs to help the user find more information?
5. Add a way to search for existing logs?
6. Add a way to delete logs?
